* Just went through list comprehension, which is something I've been lacking personal understanding in for a while now so it was good to be able to have an explanation of how to do it. I'm gonna have to give it a crack in some of my selenium test and see if I can get it to read from some text files or something in order to find all instances and do mass tests recursively.
